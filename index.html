                    <p>Many pieces of clothing are invented for a functional purpose before they ever become
                        fashionable,
                        but as
                        they become symbolic of a certain kind of lifestyle or aesthetic, certain items become
                        expressive of
                        meaning. Fashion allows individuals to create and craft images of themselves, expressing
                        their
                        identity to
                        other people and potentially arousing feelings of curiosity or commonality. Fashion is often
                        fueled
                        by the
                        desire to be different enough to stand out but similar enough to belong to the group that
                        your
                        clothing
                        helps identify.</p>

                        One question I still get relatively often has to do with combining different colors of
                        shirts,
                        pants, and shoes together.
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm keeping this as simple as possible. Three things to keep in mind:</p>

                    <p>1. Contrast is key. Light top, dark bottom, light shoes. Dark top, light bottom, dark shoes.
                        You
                        want
                        a
                        good amount of contrast among the three.
                    </p>

                    <p>2. Avoid tops that are too close to your skin tone. It makes you appear pale and washed out.
                    </p>

                    <p>3. Stay away from tonal outfits (all three pieces being the same color, or close in value).
                        It
                        can be
                        pulled off successfully, but also has the possibility of looking kind of terrible.
                    </p>
