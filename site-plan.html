        </h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p> Many pieces of clothing are invented for a functional purpose before they ever become fashionable, but as
            they become symbolic of a certain kind of lifestyle or aesthetic, certain items become expressive of
            meaning. Fashion allows individuals to create and craft images of themselves, expressing their identity to
            other people and potentially arousing feelings of curiosity or commonality. Fashion is often fueled by the
            desire to be different enough to stand out but similar enough to belong to the group that your clothing
            helps identify.</p>


        <p>One question I still get relatively often has to do with combining different colors of shirts,
            pants, and shoes together.</p>

        <p>I'm keeping this as simple as possible. Three things to keep in mind:</p>

        <p>1. Contrast is key. Light top, dark bottom, light shoes. Dark top, light bottom, dark shoes. You want a
            good amount of contrast among the three.</p>

        <p>2. Avoid tops that are too close to your skin tone. It makes you appear pale and washed out.</p>

        <p>3. Stay away from tonal outfits (all three pieces being the same color, or close in value). It can be
            pulled off successfully, but also has the possibility oflooking kind of terrible.</p>

            <p>Pairing colours can either make or break your outfit. So, it's only natural to feel a little uneasy
                when experimenting with new tones and partnerships. But, that doesn't mean you have to stick to
                plain old head-to-toe black. Here, we take you through a variety of colour-coordinated looks that
                will excite and enhance your style. From bold green and yellow outfits to chic pink and grey
                ensembles, these stylish ideas will teach you how to wear bold colours without clashing. Ready to
                embrace the rainbow? Here are the clothing colour combinations you need to try this year.</p>

            <p>Green and Yellow:</p>
            <p>There's nothing crisper than the smell of freshly cut grass on a warm summer day, and this colour
                combination is just that. Fresh and clean, green and yellow looks great on most complexions. If
                you're warm toned, focus on mustard, khaki and dark green. If you're cool toned, sharpen up an
                outfit by adding bright yellows and iridescent greens. To rock this colour combination, try
                partnering a smart yellow blazer with a simple grey skirt or
                pair of jeans. Then, add a fresh white shirt and green accessories for a bright new everyday look.
                Colour blocking is an easy way to add vibrancy and take your winter wardrobe through to the warmer
                months. Just add some solid colours to your outfit and watch the transformation. But remember, keep
                it simple and don't be afraid to mix it up.</p>

            <p>Red and Blue:</p>
            <p>The red and blue colour combination is one of our all-time favourite looks. We love how you can
                completely transform a pair of jeans with a tailored red jacket and killer heels. It's business up
                top and party on the bottom. It's sexy without being over the top, and it smartens up a casual look.
                Who can go past a classic Breton striped shirt? It's every bit the quintessential French
                Chanel-inspired look when worn with a pair of jeans and a red blazer. Alternatively, you can wear a
                crisp white shirt underneath your jacket to highlight the brightness of the red and the contrast of
                your blue jeans.</p>

            <p>Cobalt Blue and Turquoise:</p>
            <p>Combine cobalt blue with turquoise and you have a colour match that is powerful and bright. Think
                "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and wear this colour combination with elegance and class. You don't
                necessarily need to break it up with a neutral colour like white or cream, and it's one of those
                combinations that can look great with both silver and gold accessories making a versatile styling
                partnership. Your imagination only limits you. A regal blue dress, paired with a casual flat
                turquoise shoe will see you looking picture perfect
                regardless of the occasion. Pair it with a statement necklace and you'll be dreaming of nights spent
                dancing in Santorini.</p>

            <p>Orange and Black:</p>
            <p>Whether it's a dress that perfectly combines this brilliant colour combination or individual items,
                orange and black, is the new black. Nothing lifts a black outfit more than a bright, bold colour and
                orange certainly does it. Don't be shy to wear a bright coloured pant. Try a high-waisted flare pant
                and flaunt those killer
                abs with this season's must-have item, a black crop top. For those of us who prefer to keep the
                six-pack undercover, try a loosely tucked-in oversized sweater. Whatever you pair it with, don't
                forget to add some luxury to the delectable Max Mara Zebra Printed Ponyskin bag.</p>

            <p>Just as painting, writing and photography can be used as forms of artistic expression, the creation and
                wearing of fashion can similarly express creative energy. For people interested in fashion, especially
                those interested in making their own clothes by hand, sometimes the process of creating the item or the
                pure
                beauty of the item itself can hold more importance than any personal or generational statement of dress
                or meaning.</p>

            <h3>FAQ</h3>
            <p>What color clothes go together?</p>
                <p>Both contrasting and complementary colors go together well. Yellow and green have a bright spring
                    vibe, while pale blue and pink keep with the spring theme, but tone it down. If you're looking for a
                    classic color combination, go for red and blue. However, if you want to push the boundaries, try
                    orange and black, purple and coral, or tan and maroon. Each looks incredible in a unique way. Bright
                    shades also go together well — think cobalt and turquoise or orange and blue. Lastly, for an elegant
                    mix, choose purple and white, or gray and pale pink if light shades are more your vibe.</p>

                <p>What is the fashion color for 2022?</p>
                <p>It's hard to pick one color that is THE color of the year — the fashionable shades for 2020 cross
                    three spectrums - earthy tones, brights, and neutrals. In the earthy tones category, think of mossy
                    green, faded denim, warm browns, and reds, as well as turmeric. These colors work well together and
                    embrace a more natural feel. When it comes to brights, fiery red, cerulean blue, and Biscay green
                    are the big hitters. Finally, the classic neutrals of grey, black, and white are also very much
                    on-trend.</p>

                <p>What color attracts the human eye most?</p>
                <p>Bright yellow and red are the most noticeable colors. Yellow reflects a lot of light, so it grabs
                    attention quickly but can wear your eyes out. Red also stands out because of the intense emotional
                    response it can create. It's a powerful color.</p>

                <p>What are colors that clash?</p>
                <p>Most colors can clash if you don't pair them right. Both contrasting and complementary colors can
                    work well together, but you need to match both the intensity and the undertones. Pairing a
                    washed-out pastel with vibrant color will generally not be harmonious. However, if you match the
                    depth of color, it can work. That's why pastels with pastels and brights with brights can look so
                    striking. When it comes to undertones, there's warm and cool, which can appear in all types of
                    colors. It's crucial to combine warm undertones together, and the same for cool undertones;
                    otherwise, your selection will feel off.</p>
