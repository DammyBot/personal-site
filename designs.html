                    <p>Pairing colours can either make or break your outfit. So, it's only natural to feel a little
                        uneasy
                        when experimenting with new tones and partnerships. But, that doesn't mean you have to stick to
                        plain old head-to-toe black. Here, we take you through a variety of colour-coordinated looks
                        that
                        will excite and enhance your style. From bold green and yellow outfits to chic pink and grey
                        ensembles, these stylish ideas will teach you how to wear bold colours without clashing. Ready
                        to
                        embrace the rainbow? Here are the clothing colour combinations you need to try this year.</p>

                <section class="first_text">
                    <h1>Green and Yellow</h1>
                    <p>There's nothing crisper than the smell of freshly cut grass on a warm summer day, and this colour
                        combination is just that. Fresh and clean, green and yellow looks great on most complexions. If
                        you're warm toned, focus on mustard, khaki and dark green. If you're cool toned, sharpen up an
                        outfit by adding bright yellows and iridescent greens. To rock this colour combination, try
                        partnering a smart yellow blazer with a simple grey skirt or
                        pair of jeans. Then, add a fresh white shirt and green accessories for a bright new everyday
                        look.
                        Colour blocking is an easy way to add vibrancy and take your winter wardrobe through to the
                        warmer
                        months. Just add some solid colours to your outfit and watch the transformation. But remember,
                        keep
                        it simple and don't be afraid to mix it up.

                <section class="second_text">
                    <h1>Red and Blue</h1>
                    <p>The red and blue colour combination is one of our all-time favourite looks. We love how you can
                        completely transform a pair of jeans with a tailored red jacket and killer heels. It's business
                        up
                        top and party on the bottom. It's sexy without being over the top, and it smartens up a casual
                        look.
                        Who can go past a classic Breton striped shirt? It's every bit the quintessential French
                        Chanel-inspired look when worn with a pair of jeans and a red blazer. Alternatively, you can
                        wear a
                        crisp white shirt underneath your jacket to highlight the brightness of the red and the contrast
                        of
                        your blue jeans.

                <section class="third_text">
                    <h1>Cobalt Blue and Turquoise</h1>
                    <p>Combine cobalt blue with turquoise and you have a colour match that is powerful and bright. Think
                        "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and wear this colour combination with elegance and class. You don't
                        necessarily need to break it up with a neutral colour like white or cream, and it's one of those
                        combinations that can look great with both silver and gold accessories making a versatile
                        styling
                        partnership. Your imagination only limits you. A regal blue dress, paired with a casual flat
                        turquoise shoe will see you looking picture perfect
                        regardless of the occasion. Pair it with a statement necklace and you'll be dreaming of nights
                        spent
                        dancing in Santorini.

                <section class="fourth_text">
                    <h1>Orange and Black</h1>
                    <p>Whether it's a dress that perfectly combines this brilliant colour combination or individual
                        items,
                        orange and black, is the new black. Nothing lifts a black outfit more than a bright, bold colour
                        and
                        orange certainly does it. Don't be shy to wear a bright coloured pant. Try a high-waisted flare
                        pant
                        and flaunt those killer
                        abs with this season's must-have item, a black crop top. For those of us who prefer to keep the
                        six-pack undercover, try a loosely tucked-in oversized sweater. Whatever you pair it with, don't
                        forget to add some luxury to the delectable Max Mara Zebra Printed Ponyskin bag.
