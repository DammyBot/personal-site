                    <h1>What color clothes go together?</h1>
                    <p>Both contrasting and complementary colors go together well. Yellow and green have a bright spring
                        vibe, while pale blue and pink keep with the spring theme, but tone it down. If you're looking
                        for a
                        classic color combination, go for red and blue. However, if you want to push the boundaries, try
                        orange and black, purple and coral, or tan and maroon. Each looks incredible in a unique way.
                        Bright
                        shades also go together well — think cobalt and turquoise or orange and blue. Lastly, for an
                        elegant
                        mix, choose purple and white, or gray and pale pink if light shades are more your vibe.</p>

                    <h1>What is the fashion color for 2022?</h1>
                    <p>It's hard to pick one color that is THE color of the year — the fashionable shades for 2020 cross
                        three spectrums - earthy tones, brights, and neutrals. In the earthy tones category, think of
                        mossy
                        green, faded denim, warm browns, and reds, as well as turmeric. These colors work well together
                        and
                        embrace a more natural feel. When it comes to brights, fiery red, cerulean blue, and Biscay
                        green
                        are the big hitters. Finally, the classic neutrals of grey, black, and white are also very much
                        on-trend.</p>

                <section class="third_faq">
                    <h1>What color attracts the human eye most?</h1>
                    <p>Bright yellow and red are the most noticeable colors. Yellow reflects a lot of light, so it grabs
                        attention quickly but can wear your eyes out. Red also stands out because of the intense
                        emotional
                        response it can create. It's a powerful color.

                <section class="fourth_faq">
                    <h1>What are colors that clash?</h1>
                    <p>Most colors can clash if you don't pair them right. Both contrasting and complementary colors can
                        work well together, but you need to match both the intensity and the undertones. Pairing a
                        washed-out pastel with vibrant color will generally not be harmonious. However, if you match the
                        depth of color, it can work. That's why pastels with pastels and brights with brights can look
                        so
                        striking. When it comes to undertones, there's warm and cool, which can appear in all types of
                        colors. It's crucial to combine warm undertones together, and the same for cool undertones;
                        otherwise, your selection will feel off. </p>
